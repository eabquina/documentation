## Before You Begin
Be sure that you have a:

- Registered domain name using 1&1 to host DNS
- [Paid Pantheon plan](/docs/guides/going-live/plans/)
- [Domain connected](/docs/guides/going-live/domains/) to the target Pantheon environment (typically Live)

## Configure DNS Records on 1&1
### A/AAAA Records
1. Click **Domain Center** from the Domains panel.
2. Click the down arrow to the right of the domain you want to point to Pantheon, then click **Edit DNS Settings**.
3. Click the **Other IP address** option from the IP address (A Record) menu.
4. Enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the IPv4 Address field and the AAAA record values in the IPv6 Address field. There are two AAAA records for improved uptime and reliability.

4. Click **Save**.
### CNAME Record
The CNAME record is only required if you wish to include `www` within your site's primary domain name.

1. Click **Domain Center** from the Domains panel.
2. Click the down arrow to the right of the domain you want to point to Pantheon, then click **Create Subdomain**.
3. Enter `www` then click the **Create Subdomain** button.  
4. Navigate to **Domains** > **Manage Domains** then click the down arrow to the right of the domain and select **Manage Subdomains**.
5. Find the `www` subdomain and click the down arrow then **Edit DNS Settings**.
6. Select CNAME and enter the record value provided by Pantheon (e.g. `live-example.pantheonsite.io`) in the **Alias** field.
7. Check "I am aware and accept that all current DNS settings, e-mail addresses and redirects will be disabled".
8. Click **Save**, then **Yes** to confirm.


### TXT Record
The TXT record is only required if you need to prove ownership of your domain in order to pre-provision certificates to avoid HTTPS service interruption.

1. Click **Domain Center** from the Domains panel.
2. Click the down arrow to the right of the domain you want to point to Pantheon, then click **Edit DNS Settings**.
3.
4. Enter the TXT record value provided by Pantheon
