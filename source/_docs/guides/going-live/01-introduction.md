Welcome! This guide is designed to guide you to launching your site live on Pantheon with DNS configuration and SSL enabled. It should take less than 1 hour to complete (depending on DNS server change timing).

**In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:**

* Set Service Level
* Connect a domain you own to your Pantheon site
* Enable HTTPS
* Redirect all traffic to your primary domain
* Perform best practice based final launch checks

To get started you will need to have a site deployed to the Live environment and have a registered domain name where you can control DNS settings.
