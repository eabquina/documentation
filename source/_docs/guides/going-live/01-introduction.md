Welcome! This guide is designed to help you take your first site live on Pantheon.

**In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:**

* Upgrade your site to a paid plan
* Add your Custom Domain to Pantheon
* Enable Free & Automatic HTTPS
* Redirect traffic to your primary domain (e.g. `www.example.com` or `example.com`)

To get started you'll need to [create the Live environment](/docs/guides/getting-started/create-test-live/) and have a registered domain name where you can control DNS settings.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
Pantheon is not a domain registrar and we do not offer DNS management as a service. To connect a Custom Domain to Pantheon, you'll need to register one with a third-party provider.
