The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file contains default values for the configuration settings stored in the `pantheon.yml` file. `pantheon.upstream.yml` may contain any of the settings described in the [Advanced Configuration](/docs/pantheon-yml/#advanced-site-configuration) section of the [pantheon.yml file documentation](/docs/pantheon-yml). The `api_version` property is mandetory in `pantheon.upstream.yml` file, just as it is in `pantheon.yml`.

The `pantheno.upstream.yml` file cannot define any Quicksilver workflows.

If a property such as `php_version` is defined in `pantheon.upstream.yml`, then its value will be used only if the `pantheon.yml` file does not define the same property. Configuration will always be taken from `pantheon.yml` whenever it exists there.

The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file may only be edited in the upstream repository where it is defined; configuration changes for a specific site should be made with the `pantheon.yml` file. See the [Create a Custom Upstream](/docs/create-custom-upstream) documentation for information on how to set up an upstream. Similarly, an upstream should not define a `pantheon.yml` file; it should place configuration settings in `pantheon.upstream.yml` instead.

### Example File Contents

The `pantheon.upstream.yml` file should contain default content similar to the example file shown below:
```yaml
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Do not edit this file unless you are doing so in your custom upstream repository.
# Override the defaults specified here in a site-specific `pantheon.yml` file.
# For more information see: https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-upstream-yml
api_version: 1
php_version: 7.0
```
